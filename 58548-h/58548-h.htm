<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A
Sermon.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">2 <span
class="smcap">Kings</span>, 6th Chap. v. 6.</p>
<p><i>And the Man of God said</i>, <i>Where fell it</i>?&nbsp;
<i>And he shewed him the place</i>, <i>and he cut down a
stick</i>, <i>and cast it in thither</i>, <i>and the iron did
swim</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> scripture is written for our
instruction in the knowledge of the Person and Work of God our
dear Saviour, as the only foundation of our hope, the object of
our faith and love, the only refuge of guilty man, the brightness
of the Father&rsquo;s glory, and the express image of his love,
his wisdom, and his infinite condescension.&nbsp; Holy men of old
spake, and wrote the sacred scriptures, under the divine
influence of the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Christ is the main object they
all believed in, looked to, hoped for, and held forth to
succeeding generations.&nbsp; Christ is the substance of the
whole Bible; every passage, in some way or other, like the Star
of Bethlehem, points to him; and the most wise and spiritual
children of the Most High, as divinely taught, must be ever upon
the look-out for Jesus in every part of the divine word.&nbsp;
Christ is in every doctrine, in every sacred illustrious
character, in <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>every type, in every ordinance, and in every precept, in
every promise, and every Old Testament history, as well as every
New Testament parable: and where the mind is sweetly influenced
by the love of Jesus, it gladly receives Christ wherever it is
given by the Spirit to see him.</p>
<p>I would not be wise above what is written, nor would I attempt
to force the meaning of the blessed Spirit, or misapply it to
answer any purpose; but I must humbly beg to remark, that in
reading the circumstance which I have selected for a text, my
mind was at first forcibly struck with the account; and looking
up for wisdom to preach on it, and having been favored with the
gracious presence of my Lord in handling it, I could no longer
suppress my own feelings, with the earnest solicitations of many
that heard it, who were apparently blessed by this feeble
testimony, I present it in the simple form, as in part
preached.&nbsp; I have tried to retain the substance, though I am
not able to write verbatim, what was delivered: I only aim at
setting forth the glory of the dear Saviour, as held forth in
this passage, to the Church; that by comparing spiritual truths
with spiritual experiences, some of God&rsquo;s tried people may
be built up in their most holy faith, and sweetly led to see that
they have not believed in vain.</p>
<p>We find in this history, that the Spirit of Prophecy <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>in the Church
was increasing in the land; this was doubtless a favourable sign,
for <i>where there is no vision the people perish</i>; and truly
happy is that land which abounds in spiritual ministers,
spiritual ordinances, and spiritual people.&nbsp; The increase of
Prophets rendered it necessary that they should be convened
together, tor the promotion of each other&rsquo;s knowledge and
comfort.&nbsp; We find there was a College of them at Gilgal,
over which the prophet Elisha was a President, in the room of his
Predecessor Elijah.&nbsp; We would, indeed, humbly hope, this
College of Prophets, was a blessing to the Church, and that the
Candidates for the Ministry were really moved by the Holy Ghost,
to take upon them that sacred office; but, alas! in those days
was Gehazi, and others, who, it is to be feared, never were
taught either Law or Gospel, experimentally; and may we not adopt
the old Church Service, and exclaim, with grief of heart, <i>As
it was in the beginning is now</i>?&nbsp; But our most blessed
Lord will do all his will, perform all his gracious purposes, and
as the great Head of the Church, and Saviour of the body, he must
bring all his redeemed to the knowledge of himself, and at last
home to glory, by all the means his own infinite wisdom has
planned, whether they are educated at a Collage, or not.&nbsp;
Human learning is a blessing to the Church, when sanctified; but
most mere letter-learned men, like Pilate, fix their Hebrew,
Greek, and Latin upon the head of Christ, <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>instead of
laying it at his feet, as Paul did.&nbsp; Most probably the
College of Gilgal was at this time full, so that some of the Sons
of the Prophets asked leave to go to Jordan, and reside
there&mdash;we are informed of the reason of this request, in the
first of this chapter.&nbsp; Their piety, humility, and industry
are evident.&nbsp; The matter was laid before Elisha and before
the Lord, by him; so should God&rsquo;s dear ministers and people
ever act&mdash;<i>for in the multitude of counsellors there is
safety</i>; and hence that very important advice, <i>In all thy
ways acknowledge him</i>, <i>and he shall direct thy
paths</i>.&nbsp; The humility of their minds is as clearly
revealed; they did not desire a mansion, or even an elegant
college, but only an humble cot&mdash;a little, with the fear and
love of God, is far, yea, infinitely preferable to great
riches.&nbsp; The main study of ministers should be usefulness;
great riches seldom promote much spirituality in ministers or
people: those who are running an heavenly race, should not load
themselves with thick clay.&nbsp; The gospel ministry is called a
warfare, and an aged father in the church, observes to his son
Timothy, <i>No man that warreth should entangle himself in the
affairs of this life</i>&mdash;that is, if he can avoid it.</p>
<p>Not only the piety and humility of these good men are evident,
but their industry; not to be burdensome to any, they went to
work themselves, in the thicket, near the river Jordan, the
resort of wild <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>beasts; but the appointed path of duty, is, in general,
the place of safety; here the Lord had directed them, and being
in <i>his</i> way, he doubtless honoured them with <i>his</i>
protecting, supporting, and approving smile.&mdash;Elisha was
with them, superintending their affairs, and entreating the Lord
for their success.&nbsp; This act, thus recorded by the divine
Spirit, of the conduct of the Prophets, in cutting down the
thickets of trees, and building an House, might perhaps have
brought to their minds, the work to which they were called, and
for which they were preparing.&mdash;Sinners are called Trees;
the Gospel is compared to an Axe; Ministers are called Labourers;
and if they find but little success in their work, they are
directed to Jesus for strength, and to the blessed Spirit for
wisdom to aim right.&nbsp; Perhaps Solomon alludes to this, when
he says, <i>If the Iron be blunt</i>, <i>he must put to the more
strength</i>; <i>but wisdom is profitable to
direct</i>.&mdash;Agreeable to this is the language of our Lord
to his Disciples, when fishing; he said, <i>Follow we</i>, <i>and
I will make you fishers of men</i>.&nbsp; Thus instructed by
Jesus, they could spiritualize their employment as fishers.&nbsp;
This World is called a Sea, the Church a Ship, Men are compared
to Fish, Ministers to fishermen, and the Gospel to a Net cast
into the Sea; thus out dear Lord improved any circumstance, for
the instruction of his dear people.</p>
<p>It appears, the Prophets were not ashamed to <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>handle an
hammer, or an axe, nor did their Master forbid it; they were
mechanics, as well as preachers.&nbsp; The Lord has often called
the meanest of men to the highest office in the Church of God,
and made them eminently useful: David from keeping Sheep; Elisha
from the Plough&rsquo;s-tail; Amos from gathering Sycamore-fruit;
the Apostles from their Barges; and those Prophets to handle the
axe, the saw, and the hammer.&nbsp; Their work as Carpenters and
Builders, serves to remind them of their spiritual
occupation&mdash;and it is worthy of observation, that when the
Holy Spirit shewed Zechariah in vision, of the future opposition
that would be made against the kingdom of Jesus, in the Gospel
Dispensation, he shewed him four Horns, and after that, he shewed
him four Carpenters, who were to fray them, cut them down; and
such were the Apostles and Ministers of the Gospel in the four
parts of the World; who were to fell trees, cut them down, lay
them low, fit them, square them according to God&rsquo;s Word,
and thus build them up an habitation for God, through the
Spirit.</p>
<p>Our text relates, that as one was felling a Beam, the head of
his Axe fell into the water; (most probably into Jordan).&nbsp;
This was a grief to him, for the reason he assigned, so that he
cried to Elisha, and said, <i>Alas</i>, <i>master</i>, <i>for it
is borrowed</i>!&nbsp; Possessing a spirit of honesty, and being
too poor to make it good to the lender, he applied to Elisha, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>not to work a
miracle, that we can tell, but because the man&rsquo;s Axe was
sunk, and the Prophet&rsquo;s work stopped.&nbsp; Thus, ministers
have constantly something to try them in their work; they well
know the world is always ready to reproach them, and the glorious
cause they espouse, which fills them with grief, but leads them
to the dear Saviour, to appear in the love of his heart, and in
the power of his arm, for their deliverance, who always kindly
assures them his grace is sufficient for them.&nbsp; Some have
conjectured that this man was an hypocrite, or a figure of all
false preachers, who run unsent of God; who preach a borrowed
experience, a borrowed system of religion; who are only in the
letter, and not in the spirit; of whose religion and preaching,
like the poor man&rsquo;s Axe, it may be truly said, <i>Alas</i>!
<i>master</i>, <i>for it was borrowed</i>.&nbsp; And hence God
threatens the Prophets, that steal his words from others, and
declares they shall not profit this people at all; nor can
unconverted, graceless preachers profit the experimental children
of God.&nbsp; A preacher must be taught the plague of his own
heart, the spirituality of God&rsquo;s Law, the value of a
precious Jesus, in his Person and Work, by God the Spirit, before
he can be useful to the Church.&nbsp; We must first know, then
speak what we know, as the Apostle says, <i>We can but speak of
the things which we have seen</i>, <i>and we are his
witnesses</i>.&nbsp; Many may borrow words from real saints, and
may appear like <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>believers indeed; nor can even the brightest saint at
all times tell a hypocrite from a saint, but the day will declare
it&mdash;<i>then</i>, <i>then shall ye return</i>, <i>and discern
between the righteous and the wicked</i>&mdash;a mere borrowed
religion will let the soul sink in death, but the free gift of
God is eternal life&mdash;locked up in Christ, manifested by the
Spirit, and leads the soul to rest, live, and rejoice alone in
the everlasting love of God, the free, unmerited grace of an
everlasting covenant, the glorious person, and finished work of
Christ, as its all in all.</p>
<p>The Prophet seeing the situation of his pupil, cut down a
stick from a tree, and cast it into the water, when behold a most
astonishing miracle appears&mdash;the stick, contrary to its
native tendency, sunk, and brought up the iron head of the axe,
which swam, contrary to its natural gravitation.&mdash;The man no
doubt joyfully received it, and went on with his work.&nbsp; What
cannot, what will not the God of Israel do for his people, to
shew he is the Lord their God, that they are his servants, and
that they are acting agreeable to his will.&nbsp; The Lord
confirmeth the work of his servants and frustrateth the tokens of
liars; and surely the petition of Elijah is exactly adapted, in
many cases, to God&rsquo;s dear ministers, when he prayed, and
said, <i>Lord God</i>, <i>let it be known this day that I am thy
servant</i>, <i>that this is thy people</i>, <i>and that I have
done all these things according to thy word</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Our
text reads thus: <i>But as one was felling a beam</i>, <i>the axe
head fell into the water</i>; <i>and he cried</i>, <i>and
said</i>, <i>Alas</i>! <i>Master</i>, <i>for it was
borrowed</i>.&nbsp; <i>And the man of God said</i>, <i>Where fell
it</i>?&nbsp; <i>And he shewed him the place</i>.&nbsp; <i>And he
cut down a stick and cast it in thither</i>, <i>and the iron did
swim</i>&mdash;<i>therefore said he</i>, <i>take it up to
thee</i>, <i>and he put out his hand</i>, <i>and took it</i>.</p>
<p>In further considering this most instructive subject, I would
take occasion to notice our fall and recovery, in the two heads;
Adam, the sinful head and representative of all mankind; and the
adorable Jesus, the elect head of his dear people.&nbsp; It is a
solemn and a glorious truth, that as in Adam all die, so in
Christ shall all be made alive.&nbsp; Or, as the learned say it
is literally in the Greek, All in Adam die; all in Christ shall
be made alive.&nbsp; Here are the two heads, and no
more&mdash;the one represents all mankind&mdash;the second Adam,
all his children given to him, loved, redeemed, and saved by
him.&nbsp; Much has been said and written on the subject of the
Fall of Man: great indeed was that Fall, and dreadful has been
the consequences of it.&nbsp; All the miseries in earth and hell
are the consequences of it.&nbsp; Alas! how deeply fallen is man
into the mire of corruption, sin, and folly; and into the waters
of deep affliction&mdash;sunk, as iron cast or dropped into the
waters of Jordan, which naturally <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>gravitates to its own centre.&nbsp;
Our nature was sunk so deep, that it was apparently lost, and so
incapacitated, that it has no more power to come up out of it,
than iron has to swim of itself, independent of a
miracle&mdash;covered over, sunk in earth, yea, the Apostle
asserts, it is earthly, sensual, and devilish; having fallen from
wisdom, and become foolish; from righteousness, and become a
criminal; from holiness, and become impure; and from happy
freedom, to awful bondage.&nbsp; The powers of the soul, all the
noble talents that were only lent; these are awfully depraved,
yea, so evil, that I am bold to assert, no man can believe he is
as vile as the Bible declares him, till he is put in the
possession of the faith of God&rsquo;s elect.&nbsp; There
requires as much divine power, to credit the state of man, as to
believe in the salvation of the soul.&nbsp; The same faith the
holy Spirit gives to see Jesus, believe in Jesus, and rest on
Jesus, is required to believe the desperate depravity of the
human heart.&nbsp; The same light in which I see the new man, I
see the old; in the same teaching I see truth, I discover the
aboundings of error, and by the same anointing I behold my
standing in the second Adam, I see my fall in the first.&nbsp;
But it is well for the people of God, who are acquainted with
their fallen natures, that the holy Spirit leads them to see the
glorious remedy in the gospel; that as the Law enters, sin being
discovered, weakness felt, corruption a burden, misery groaned
under, and the awful consequences <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>deplored.&nbsp; The Gospel is so
highly esteemed by such persons, and none know the value of the
Gospel, but those who feel their sins, and see them in the light
of the Law, as deserving the wrath of a holy God; and finding the
utter impossibility of keeping the Law, in thought, word, or
deed&mdash;that the law condemns most justly for a sinful
thought, as well as a sinful action.&nbsp; Hence the dear
Redeemer, in his grand Sermon on the Mount, preached this Law in
its spirituality, and insisted upon it, that anger in the heart
against another without cause, was murder; and a lustful glance
of the eye, adultery.&nbsp; Truly believing this testimony from
the word, and by the teaching of the Spirit out of the Law, we
must exclaim, What flesh can be saved?&nbsp; The scripture
answers, (and all the election of grace is brought to believe it)
<i>Therefore by the deeds of the Law shall no flesh be justified
in his sight</i>.&nbsp; But it is the grand design of the Gospel,
to open to a poor sinner, the glorious plan of salvation, by the
joint work of the ever adorable trinity in unity.&nbsp; And it is
the business of gospel ministers, to be ever stating the precious
truths of the Gospel, and pointing poor guilty man to the blessed
means whereby he can be justified and pardoned.&nbsp; This leads
me to notice the conduct of the Prophet; when the man cried on
account of his loss to him, he cut down a stick, and cast it in
thither, and the iron did swim.&nbsp; Many great events were done
at Jordan, it divided when the Israelites were to pass over to
Canaan.&nbsp; <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>As soon as the Ark, borne upon the shoulders of the
priests, made its appearance, the waters parted.&nbsp; Hence the
Psalmist asks, <i>What ailed thee</i>, <i>O thou Sea</i>, <i>that
thou fleddest</i>, <i>and thou Jordan</i>, <i>that thou wast
driven back</i>.&nbsp; Another text answers, <i>The waters saw
thee</i>, <i>O God</i>, <i>in the midst of Jordon</i>.&nbsp;
Joshua set up twelve stones in remembrance of the surprising
event.&nbsp; Jacob passed over it twice, once with a heavy
disconsolate heart, in leaving his home&mdash;and twenty years
after, he passed the same place, and called to remembrance the
gracious conduct of his God; <i>with this Staff I passed over
Jordan</i>, <i>and now I am become two bands</i>.&nbsp; Elijah
and Elisha smote the waters of Jordan with the same Mantle, but
the most distinguished honour that was ever conferred on Jordan,
was the descent of the lovely Son of God into them, by the
ordinance of baptism, when the adorable Spirit alighted upon him,
visible, though in the manner in which a Dove hovers in its
descent; and Jesus was anointed to enter into his great work,
while the Father bore testimony to him as his beloved Son, in
whom he rested, pleased with him, and all his dear people in
him.&nbsp; In the waters of Jordan the Axe head fell, and
gravitating to its centre, sunk deep, no doubt, in the mire at
the bottom, but a stick is cut down, cast in, sinks deep, and
brings up the head, by causing it to swim&mdash;this was the
means; and who can read this circumstance with attention, but
must be reminded of him, who is the stem of <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Jesse, who
was so many years typified by the rod of Moses, who performed so
many wonders for the children of Israel, and is, in a certain
sense, doing the same for his people in the wilderness to this
day.&nbsp; He was also typified by the rod of Aaron, which
budded, blossomed, and yielded almonds&mdash;to all human
appearance, a very unpromising object, a dry stick.&nbsp; This is
he, of whom the prophet Isaiah spake, perhaps in allusion to
Aaron&rsquo;s rod, <i>He shall come up before him like a tender
plant</i>, <i>and as a root out of a dry ground</i>; to all human
appearance, a very unlikely person to be the Messiah, the Saviour
of men.&nbsp; But another chapter holds forth his qualifications,
<i>And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse</i>,
<i>and a branch shall grow out of his root</i>.&nbsp; So says the
Lord by another Prophet, <i>Behold my servant</i>, <i>the
Branch</i>.&nbsp; And the Lord again, by Ezekiel, says, <i>I will
take off the top of his branch a young twig</i>, <i>and I will
set it</i>, <i>and under his branches shall dwell all fowl of
every wing</i>.&nbsp; And perhaps, in allusion to this, the dear
Saviour compares himself to a grain of mustard seed, small when
sown, but large when grown, so that the birds of the air lodge in
the branches thereof.&nbsp; This was to shew the reality of his
human nature, his amazing condescension, his deep abasement, and
the meanness of his descent.&nbsp; As man, humbled himself to the
form of a servant, and as the saviour of the body, of which he is
the head, the Father called him to the great work of redemption,
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and said,
<i>Thou art my servant</i>, <i>O Israel</i>, <i>in whom I will be
glorified</i>.&nbsp; He gave him to the church, to deliver it
from the ruins of the fall, and, as a Branch, he was cut off from
the land of the living.&nbsp; Hence the prediction, <i>Messiah
shall be cut off</i>, <i>but not for himself</i>.&nbsp; He was
indeed cut off from the synagogue of the Jews, from the carnal
worldling, and from the proud Pharisee.&nbsp; He was cut off from
his own relatives, from his own dear disciples for a time, from
every earthly comfort and convenience, and cut off from the land
of the living, by a most violent, painful, and shameful death;
<i>for the transgression of my people was he stricken</i>.&nbsp;
He was cast into the deep waters.&nbsp; He had been baptized in
water at Jordan&mdash;now he must be baptized in blood, and
sweet, and tears.&nbsp; Hence his deep afflictions are called
waters; and he sighed and said, <i>Save me O God</i>, <i>the
waters are come in unto my soul</i>.&nbsp; <i>I sink in deep
mire</i>.&nbsp; <i>I am come into deep waters</i>, <i>where the
floods overflow me</i>.&nbsp; <i>Deliver me out of the deep
waters</i>, <i>and out of the mire</i>.&nbsp; <i>Let me be
delivered from them that hate me</i>.&nbsp; Hence we see our dear
Lord sinking with the blood of our guilt, bearing our sins,
sustaining our curse, and enduring the hell that we had
merited&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He sunk beneath our heavy woes,<br />
To raise us to his throne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tells his gracious design to fetch us up from <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>destruction,
to make atonement for all our transgressions, to fulfil all the
Law&rsquo;s demands, to satisfy the justice of God, to harmonize
every divine attribute, to redeem his dear people from the curse,
to open a way of access to God, to sanctify every temporal
blessing, to incense the gift of the Holy Ghost, and that our old
man might be crucified, that the whole body of death might be
destroyed, to conquer sin, to subdue Satan, to bar the mouth of
hell, to rend the vail of the temple, to open the pearly gates of
the celestial city, to remove spiritual death, to take away the
sting of temporal death, to finish transgression, make an end of
sin, bring in an everlasting righteousness, make reconciliation
for iniquity, and to make himself an everlasting name; and he
must, he shall have, all the glory, from first to last.&nbsp;
Thus Jews died for these grand purposes&mdash;death is our life;
he hath raised us up in himself, raised up our poor fallen
natures indeed; and by virtue of his work we are restored to the
image of God in regeneration, to communion with God in
conversion, and to the likeness of Christ in our
resurrection.&nbsp; Glory be to his dear name for stooping so low
to raise us so high; nor will he ever give over the wonders of
his grace till we are raised out of the mire of corruption,
indwelling sin, and out of the waters of all affliction; for the
Lord will perfect his begun good work, for his mercy endureth for
ever.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Thus we
see our fall, and our recovery in Christ.&nbsp; Not that the dear
people of God, in one sense, ever fell out of the flavour of God,
or were ever liable to be damned; but the nature of sin in
God&rsquo;s people is the same as in the reprobate, and requires
an infinite satisfaction&mdash;this being given a free
proclamation is issued out to all who feel their need of this
Jesus; they are welcome to him, and he has graciously assured
such he will in no wise cast them out&mdash;and this is a promise
worth a thousand worlds, and gladly accepted by them that
believe, <i>That Jesus Christ came into the world to save
sinners</i>.&mdash;Praise ye the Lord.</p>
<p>There is one thought more worthy our attention as the people
of God.&nbsp; When the Apostle enumerates the vast privileges of
God&rsquo;s dear children, as one with Christ, the property of
Christ, as Christ is God&rsquo;s&mdash;he infers that the
ministry of the Gospel is none of the smallest in the inventory:
<i>all are yours</i>, <i>whether Paul or
Cephas</i>&mdash;implying that the calling and qualification of
ministers is for the Church: and the Apostle adds, in another
place, that even the very afflictions of the ministers are for
the Church.&nbsp; Hence, he says, <i>If we be afflicted it is for
your consolation</i>.&nbsp; And again, <i>All things are for your
sakes</i>.&nbsp; So then death worketh in us, but life in
you.&nbsp; For this cause we faint not.&nbsp; As a Candle which
burneth, consumeth away itself to give light to others, so it is
true of ministers; they <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>are quickened by the Spirit, united
to Jesus, love his person, name, and work, his truths, his
people, and his ways.&nbsp; And being called into public life, by
the great head of the church, they are cut off from the world and
its maxims, its religion, and its bare form the power.&nbsp; They
are cast into many waters of affliction; they are plunged deep,
even into the mire, to bring up some poor soul by their
instrumentality.&nbsp; Why are they led to feel more deep the
depravity of the human heart, but that they might be able to
describe its workings.&nbsp; Why are they so deeply exercised
with the discipline of the Law, but that they might describe the
cases of them who are under its workings, and so often liable to
a spirit of bondage.&nbsp; Why have they uncommon temptations
from the adversary, but that they, like their divine Lord, might
sympathize with the tempted, and being well acquainted with
Satan&rsquo;s devices, that they might expose them.&nbsp; Why
cast down because of the troubles of the way, but that they might
seek only to Jesus; that they might learn, experimentally, how to
make use of a precious Saviour, as exactly adapted for such
cases.&nbsp; Why more reproached.&nbsp; Why more exposed to
temptations.&nbsp; Why is Satan more busy with them.&nbsp; Why,
perhaps, more tried in their families; plagued with erroneous
characters of every description; tried in the world; perplexed in
the church; in perils often among false brethren; exercised in <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>mind, with
the sins of professors; the weakness of God&rsquo;s own dear
children; the envy of their own brethren; and the aboundings of
iniquity and error in the World.&nbsp; The fears of not being
called to the work aright; the little success they meet with;
their dead seasons in the pulpit; and the very little progress in
the Church among God&rsquo;s children, in their knowledge of
divine things.&nbsp; The instability of their hearers; the cruel
criticisms, uncharitable reflections, and unpleasant speeches,
mixed with the contempt of the proud.&nbsp; The apostacy of some
from the truth, after a blazing profession, and professing to be
called under our ministry; with the envy of poor niggardly
professors, who, perhaps, never gave a shilling to the cause of
Jesus, yet grudge every good thing the Lord gives them, and they
receive with the sanction of the great head of the church, the
heir of all things.&nbsp; These, and many more afflictions the
dear ministers of the sanctuary experience.&nbsp; Oh! if many
pious young men, who are anxious for the ministry, even from the
best of motives, if they could foresee what they would pass
through before they finish their course, they would venture
forward with more trembling steps than they do.&nbsp; These
trials made one of the greatest preachers (next to our dear Lord
himself) exclaim, <i>Who is sufficient for these
things</i>?&nbsp; But glory be to Jesus, our sufferings are of
God, and our trials are not merely for ourselves, as believers,
but for the sake of God&rsquo;s dear children.&nbsp; <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>We are often
cast into these deep waters, to dive after some who have sunk
very low in soul, either in the waters of affliction, or in the
deep mire of known, felt, lamented, and painful
corruptions.&nbsp; This teaching made Paul understand all things,
and all men: if he met with a soul in deep terrors, he could
describe their state, and point out their feelings, having known
the terrors of the Lord.&nbsp; If in bondage, if filled with
fears, if depressed in soul, if exercised with fiery darts, if
fearful of falling away, if fallen into sin, if distressed with a
load of trials, if persecuted, reproached, apparently forsaken,
and dejected, he knows how to prescribe the remedy, as well as to
describe the state, both is a mercy&mdash;and to be led by the
divine Spirit, to be deeply acquainted with sin and its miseries,
with Jesus and his salvation, experimentally; to be called, and
enabled to preach both, with the testimony of God to the soul, is
a mercy for a minister; and what is he without such
teaching?&nbsp; For the whole design of the Spirit, leading to
all the miseries of our fallen nature, is but to endear Christ,
and that we might prize the precious truths of the Gospel, as
they exhibit to us the only remedy for all our woes; the mystery
of the adorable trinity in unity, with the several covenant acts
of love to the election of grace; the glorious undertaking of our
adorable surety; the exact suitability of Jesus; his infinite
birth, his infinite life of obedience, his most wonderful death,
his glorious resurrection, his <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>prevalent intercession, his covenant
engagements, his precious promises, his gracious presence, his
astonishing pity, his boundless compassion, his free grace, his
saving offices, his glorious perfections, his mediatorial
glories, his sweet titles, his precious characters, and his
numerous appearances for his church.&nbsp; These clearly stated
to God&rsquo;s chosen, without the mixture of free-will, human
performances, or any of the effects of old Adam&rsquo;s nature,
will be owned and blessed to God&rsquo;s own children, their
glorious remedy for every malady; while the faithful minister
will be led to see the gracious design of his God, in permitting
him to feel, and leading him into deep waters.</p>
<p>I conclude by observing once more on this subject, that all
the Lord&rsquo;s children are the subjects of many sinkings of
soul, arising from inbred sin, felt guilt, lamented depravity,
heavy trials, sore besetments, family troubles, and grievous
backslidings.&nbsp; The holy Spirit is always carrying on his own
work, by leading us daily to see and feel what we are, as
sinners, in the first Adam&rsquo;s head; and what we are, as
saints, in Christ Jesus, the second Adam, the Lord from
heaven.&nbsp; This is blessed teaching, it leads from all
self-righteousness, self-wisdom, self-dependance, and
self-adulation; it leads alone to the dear God-man Mediator, as
the glorious fountain of untreated good, as the centre of a
believing soul, and as its eternal all in <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>all.&nbsp;
The teachings of the Spirit, though accompanied with numerous
trials, known only to those who are taught of God, are, at the
same time, sweet evidences of our eternal election, divine
predestination, gracious adoption, compleat justification, and
eternal pardon.&nbsp; And the holy Spirit has engaged to act as a
gracious comforter in the soul, to fetch us up when sunk in
sorrow, dismay, and despair; and will put this sweet song in our
mouths, <i>He brought me up also out of the horrible pit and
mirey clay</i>.&nbsp; And he will also quicken our mortal bodies,
and bring us up again from the territories of the grave; for the
Lord said, <i>I will bring again from Bashan</i>; <i>I will bring
my people up again from the depths of the Sea</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
